# Turbine-Core Sub-Project

This directory contains the core infrastructure for the project, sonsisting
of the model export, runtime, and kernel development APIs. It is packaged
and released as the 
[`SHARK-Turbine` project on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/shark-turbine/).

It depends purely on PyTorch and the IREE compiler/runtime.

See the repository-level README for further information.
