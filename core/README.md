# Turbine-Core Sub-Project

This directory contains the core infrastructure for the project, consisting
of the model export, runtime, and kernel development APIs. It is packaged
and released as the
[`iree-turbine` project on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/iree-turbine/)
(previously [`SHARK-Turbine`](https://pypi.org/project/shark-turbine/)).

It depends purely on PyTorch and the IREE compiler/runtime.

See the repository-level README for further information.
