# Turbine Roadmap

## Path to V1

In the short term, we are investing in Turbine to make it feature complete
and usable for:

* *AOT export* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/125)
* *Serving SHARK Gen-AI Models* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/119)
* *Integration with Quantization Workflows* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/120)
* *General eager execution* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/105)
* *FX Importer Completion* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/139)

We are also investing in project infrastructure:

* *Releasing* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/121)
* *CI and Testing* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/122)
* *Upstreaming* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/123)
* *User Documentation and Samples* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/124)
* *Developer/Debugging Workflows* (https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/issues/75)

Roughly, we will aim to align delivery of these features with the next official
PyTorch release, at which point we will track PyTorch versions as our versioning
scheme.
